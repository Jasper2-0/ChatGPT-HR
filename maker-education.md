**Can you give me a short summary of what maker education is about?**

> Maker education is a type of learning that focuses on hands-on, experiential, and creative activities that allow students to design, build, and create things. It typically involves the use of tools and materials such as wood, metal, textiles, electronics, and software to make a wide variety of projects. Maker education often emphasizes collaboration, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills, and is often seen as a way to foster innovation and creativity in learners.


**Can you give me a short summary of what a fab lab is?**

>A fab lab is a small-scale workshop that provides access to advanced digital fabrication technologies, such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and computer-controlled milling machines. These technologies allow users to quickly prototype and create a wide range of products, from complex electronic devices to custom-made furniture. Fab labs are often seen as a key component of maker education, as they provide learners with the tools and technology they need to turn their ideas into reality. Fab labs are often found in schools, community centers, and other public spaces, and are often run by trained facilitators who can help users learn how to use the equipment and software.


**Can you explain how maker education and fab labs are intertwined?**


> Maker education and fab labs are closely connected, as fab labs often provide the tools and technology that are used in maker education. Maker education emphasizes hands-on, experiential learning, and often involves the use of tools and materials to design, build, and create things. Fab labs provide access to advanced digital fabrication technologies, such as 3D printers and laser cutters, which can be used to quickly prototype and create a wide range of projects. As such, fab labs are often seen as a key component of maker education, providing learners with the resources they need to bring their ideas to life. Additionally, many fab labs are run by trained facilitators who can help learners learn how to use the equipment and software, further supporting the goals of maker education.



**I need to run a workshop on maker education inside a fab lab, can you give me some learning goals, using the three highest levels of bloom's taxonomy?**

> Sure, here are three learning goals using the three highest levels of Bloom's taxonomy:
